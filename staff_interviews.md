# Staff Interviews

## Chef Gordon (Head of Kitchen)

> **"I don't trust the waiters."**
> 
> They write like doctors. I can't read 'Ckn Psta'. Is that Chicken Pasta? Chicken Pesto? Last week I made a Chicken Pesto for a guy with a nut allergy because the waiter forgot to write 'NO NUTS' on the ticket. We almost called an ambulance.
> 
> Also, I waste an hour every morning counting inventory. I need to know before the dinner rush if we are out of steaks. Right now, I only find out when I go to the fridge and it's empty, and then I have to scream at the waiter to go tell the customer we're out. It's embarrassing.

## Sarah (Head Waitress)

> **"The tables are a war zone."**
> 
> We have no way to know which tables are free. I walked a couple all the way to Table 4, only to find out Mark had already sat someone there 2 minutes ago. We looked like idiots walking them back to the front.
> 
> And payment? Don't get me started. A group of 5 wants to split the bill? I have to get a calculator and do the math on a napkin. If I make a mistake, the cash register is short, and Marco takes it out of my tips. I need a button that just says 'Split Bill'.

## Alex (Part-time Manager)

> **"Who is actually working?"**
> 
> Marco asks me 'Who was the waiter for Table 12 last night?' and I have to dig through a pile of sticky notes. Sometimes waiters swap shifts without telling me. If a customer complains about service, I don't know who to reprimand. I need a login system so I know exactly who put in that order.
