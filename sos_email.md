Hi Team,

Thanks for agreeing to help us. As I mentioned on the phone, we are expanding to a second floor, but our current system (pen, paper, and a 10-year-old cash register) is collapsing.

**Last Friday was a disaster.** We had a table of 8 walk out because their food took 90 minutes, and later I found out the kitchen never even got their ticket because it fell behind the stove.

Also, my accountant is asking why we bought 50kg of mozzarella last week when we only sold 20 pizzas. I have no idea. I suspect staff might be giving away free food or taking ingredients home, but I can't prove it because I don't know who worked which shift.

I've attached notes from my staff. Please design us a system that stops this bleeding.

Best,  
Marco
